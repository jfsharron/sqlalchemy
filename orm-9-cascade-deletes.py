# if database supports and configured on-delete-cascade on foreign key the db can take care of deleting
# children. This is more efficient than above approach because sqlalchemy has to load data first
# and delete them one by one. You can tell sqlalchemy that a relationship has on-delete-cascade configured
# on db level so db will do deletes automatically - this is more efficient.
